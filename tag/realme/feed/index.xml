<p>1- Friends, first of all, what happens is that the charger cable or charger of our smartphone gets damaged. So we don&#8217;t take that company&#8217;s charger.

Due to this the chances of getting a smartphone blast increase a lot.</p>



<p>2- Friends, after the USB cable of your charger, is damaged, if you get them from any market which is cheap rate cables. So even this increases the chances of your mobile getting blasted. Because they are only so cheap that they are not made with any safety in mind.</p>

<p>3- Friends, sometimes what happens is that we are doing some work with our mobile phones. And suddenly the battery of the mobile gets exhausted, then we put the mobile in charge and then start doing that work.

Because of this the battery gets discharged quickly after discharge, and children start playing games by putting their smartphones in charge. Due to this, the temperature of the mobile becomes very high while playing the game. Due to which mobiles explode Many such incidents have been seen.</p>



<p>5- Friends, whenever your smartphone is not charging and you put it in charge. And you do not have to talk on any video, game, or call while charging. Due to this, the temperature of the mobile starts increasing, and the chances of it getting blasted increase.</p>
