<p>Friends, whenever there is some new change or new update in WhatsApp. So some people like it. And some people feel bad. Some new updates are very useful for you. And some updates are so crap for you that they are of no use. But the small updates that come are of great use. If all of you are aware of the updates, then it can be very useful for you.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.intersavers.com/festival-special-offer-of-samsung-redmi-infinix/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.intersavers.com/festival-special-offer-of-samsung-redmi-infinix/">Read also&#8230;..Festival special offer of Samsung, Redmi, Infinix to know about 5G Launching in India this October</a></strong></p>



<h2>WhatsApp new 5 update</h2>



<p><strong>WhatsApp new update</strong>: 1- Friends, first of all talk about WhatsApp update. So the first update is for WhatsApp group admin. If you are the admin of any WhatsApp group. so good for you. New feature of WhatsApp If your WhatsApp group in shares the wrong video, photo or any such message. And you think these things are not right. and you want to delete it So you can delete it very easily. This video, image and message will not be deleted from your mobile, but from the devices of all the people in the group to whom it will reach.</p>



<p>Although this feature was first given to WhatsApp Beta users. That is, as many people use the beta version of WhatsApp. They must know about this feature. But now this feature has been rolled out globally. That is, you can see this feature inside any WhatsApp. If you knew about this feature. So tell me by writing in the comment box.</p>



<p>2- Friends, the second change in WhatsApp is about WhatsApp Fitter. Inside the filter you will get to see another button. It is by the name of unread that if you get a lot of messages on WhatsApp. And you see and read all those messages one by one. So some messages are left in that. So they go down quite a bit and watch us crawl it up and bring them up.</p>



<p>But now you will see by clicking in the search bar, a button of unread has come here. When you click on it, all the unread messages are there. The ones you haven&#8217;t seen or read yet. So all those messages will come together. It is good in a way, it will also save your time and you will be able to read the message quickly.</p>
